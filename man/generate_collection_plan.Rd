\arguments{
\item{manifest}{DataFrame or tibble: animal manifest with at least ID and DOB columns.}

\item{dob_name}{Character: manifest column name for date of birth.}

\item{start_age_wk}{Integer: age (weeks) at first collection.}

\item{interval_wk}{Integer: interval (weeks) between collections.}

\item{recurrence}{Integer: number of recurrence cycles (planned sample events).}
